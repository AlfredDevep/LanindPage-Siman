// Siman Page!!!

Basically it is a simple page Where I used HMTL,
CSS, BOOTSTRAP and JS!

There is a index where I rendered JS File>

Fox Example I Created a folder Where I have store the
JS file navba.js login.js contact.js footer.js clothe.js
proCard.js and then Only declared the file at the end of 
body in order to reduce code and see a better code.

I used an array of objects "ProCards.js" and then I used the 
map function in order to map the product and reduce code also!

I only used one CSS file but then I will divide the style into sections
using diferrent files
